## Crafting Interpreters in C - Lox 

This project is my journey through the fantastic book

**["Crafting Interpreters" by Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)**.The book dives deep into how programming languages work by guiding readers to build their own interpreters and then their own compiler. It does this through the creation of a dynamically typed language called Lox, a full OOP/functional/Dynamically typed PL. This is the Java implemtation, from the first part of the book

The book is truly written in FUNNY but CONCISE language. I never knew cracking jokes could go hand in hand with the dark art of creating interpreters

**Project Description:**
We are currently building an interpreted language called lox in java.. So far, we've implemented features like:

* A Parser using an Abstract Syntax Tree,to parse which produces tokens
* The visitors pattern for parsing
* Creating classes, functions, Scoping or Environments, Operators etc

  
**Future Work**
* The main aim of learning this is to be able to learn reverse engineering of malware executables in my aim to becoming a cybersecurity expert


**Conclusion:**

Thank you for checking out my project! Feel free to explore the code and see how the language is.
